  description: started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless
    necessary. restarted will always bounce the service. reloaded will always reload.
    At least one of state and enabled are required. Note that reloaded will start
    the service if it is not already started, even if your chosen init system wouldn't
    normally.

  description: If the service does not respond to the status command, name a substring
    to look for as would be found in the output of the ps command as a stand-in for
    a status result. If the string is found, the service will be assumed to be running.

- name: sleep
  required: false
  input_type: user
  description: If the service is being restarted then sleep this many seconds between
    the stop and start command. This helps to workaround badly behaving init scripts
    that exit immediately after signaling a process to stop.
