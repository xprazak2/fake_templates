Chainboots iPXE/gPXE from PXELinux via UNDI. Make sure the OS has an iPXE
template associated and the file undionly.kpxe was copied into the TFTP
directory as undionly-ipxe.0 (e.g. from /usr/share/ipxe/undionly.kpxe or
the iPXE project web site). Changes need to be made in the DHCP
configuration to prevent an endless loop to happen.
